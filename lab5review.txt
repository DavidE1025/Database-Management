Correct queries
Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the 
   fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count and group by on 
   the Products table.)

select name, city
from customers
where city in (select city
               from products
               group by city
               Order by count(name)
               limit 1);

Incorrect output
- Missing customer cities.
- This one could have been done without joins. 
- You did not test this query, why?
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.



In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things.
