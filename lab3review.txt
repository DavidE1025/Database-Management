Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE priceusd >= 1.00 AND city != 'Dallas' AND city != 'Duluth';
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



3. List the pid, name, and priceUSD of products with quantity more than
208,000.

Incorrect output
- You are giving an additional field, quantity, but you were not asked for it.


5. List the names of agents not in New York and not in Tokyo.

Incorrect output
- You are asked to give the names only, not the city.


9. List all orders from the customer whose cid is C005.

Incorrect output
- You are nor listing the orders, but customer info!


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
