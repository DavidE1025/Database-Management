Correct queries
Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable



2. Get the ids of products ordered through any agent who takes at least one
order from a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to lowest. (This is
not the same as asking for ids of products ordered by customers in Dallas.)

Incorrect output
- the query is producing incorrect output because it is not taking agents into
  account

3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent
a01.

Incorrect output
- You are giving an additional rows incorrectly.


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You discussed constraints, but not "check constraints". There is a
  difference. 


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
